        <p>I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.kth.se">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a>, Stockholm. 
            Currently, I work on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision. 
            I am supervised by <a href="https://www.kth.se/profile/ragnart">Ragnar Thobaben</a> and <a href="https://people.kth.se/~skoglund/">Mikael Skoglund</a>. 
            I received both my MSc and BSc in electrical engineering from KTH, and spent a year as an exchange student at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>,
            where I wrote my MSc thesis at the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/information-processing-and-communications-lab">Information Processing and Communications Lab</a> under Deniz Gündüz.

        <p>I work on understanding machine learning systems. I use my background in information theory and error-correcting codes to design
            and analyse deep learning systems. 
            The goal of my research is to develop more efficient learning algorithms which better capture features of the data, and whose performance
            generalise to unseen settings.
